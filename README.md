📶 Network Bandwidth Monitor
This is a simple yet effective Network Bandwidth Monitoring tool developed using Java and built with Maven in Visual Studio Code. 
The project was completed in a single day as part of hands-on learning, showcasing fundamental skills in Java programming, real-time data handling, and system resource monitoring.
🚀 Features
- Monitors real-time network upload and download speed
- Uses Java's system and networking libraries for tracking bandwidth usage
- Command-line interface for simplicity and performance
- Efficient performance with minimal resource usage
 🛠 Tech Stack
- Language: Java
- Build Tool: Maven
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
 🧑‍💻 How It Works
The program periodically checks the amount of data sent and received over the network interfaces and calculates the bandwidth used over time.
Key Concepts:
- Reading from system network interfaces using Java APIs
- Calculating bandwidth by comparing byte counts over timed intervals
- Displaying real-time results in KB/s or MB/s
📦 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-bandwidth-monitor
   cd network-bandwidth-monitor
2. Build the project using Maven:
   mvn clean install
3. Run the application:
   java -cp target/bandwidth-monitor.jar com.example.BandwidthMonitor
⚠ Prerequisites: Ensure Java (JDK) and Maven are installed and configured in your system.
